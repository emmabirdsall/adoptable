Welcome to Adoptable!

Adoptable was built with React as a final project for my Front End Developer Certificate program. It allows the user to input their zipcode and a radius
and shows them the adoptable dogs, cats or bun buns in the area using the Petfinder API.

The project only had funcitonal requirements so I chose to work with the Petfinder API because I'm passionate about adopting animals. There are so many sweet
animals who are looking for their forever home. 

This was my first React app and I don't plan on launching it for the public. It's simply a portfolio piece that I have added to since my class ended and will 
continue to keep tinkering with to grow my skills.

Thank you and enjoy!
